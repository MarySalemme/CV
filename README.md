I am an enthusiastic **Full Stack Junior Developer**. I love to learn new things and constantly challenge myself and that is the reason why I started looking into web development.  
My background is in the translation industry, as a video-game QA tester first and then as a Project Manager, in which I developed my analytical and organizational skills.   
I am looking for a role where I can keep learning how to make amazing things, possibly in a company that values pair programming and TDD.

|[Zombie Paint](https://github.com/MarySalemme/zombie-paint)|The project I've worked on in the final two weeks at makers. The aims of this project were to create a clone of MS Paint, write clean code using the TDD approach and keep learning, and we successfully reached all our objectives!|Javascript, HTML Canvas, Node/Express, Mocha/Chai, Canteen|
|[MakersBnB](https://github.com/MarySalemme/makersbnb)|Our first team project. I'm really proud of this project as we worked really hard on collaboration. We did our best to apply XP values, in particular by providing constant feedback and communicating as much as possible to avoid duplication of efforts | Ruby, Rspec/Capybara|

#### Organization and analytical thinking

My previous working experience helped me build my organizational skills and analytical thinking. When working on a new project I always do my best to gather as much information as possible to have a clear view of what needs to be done. I try to look at solutions from different points of view so to take a thought out decision.
In the background, I always keep an eye on deadlines and production times, which help me manage workload and stakeholder expectations.

#### Communication

I understand the vital importance of clear communication in a collaborative environment. Because of this, I try to be as responsive and clear as possible, so to manage expectation and avoid duplication of efforts. This could be done by a simple email to the client, explaining timelines and production challenges, or by talking through a pairing session, keeping your pair partner engaged and aware of your way of thinking.

#### Quick learning
Other than achieving what seemed impossible to me only a few months ago (that is, learning how to build a program from scratch using different languages in only 12 weeks), as a Project Manager I became responsible for the company's top client after only 5 months in the job and no previous PM experience. I can quickly pick up new processes and concepts and, as soon as I become comfortable with them, I work hard to reach my targets.
